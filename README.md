## Shelfish Project
There is something really wonderful about reading a physical book. Yes, e-books are convenient and saves space, but I love flipping the pages and touching the paper. The worst part about this is that I cannot possibly have space for all the books I want to read in my own space. This app is to help share physical books among friends (because screw the dog-ear readers), it is to keep track of the books you have on your bookshelf, but also be able to see and borrow books from your friends' shelves.
